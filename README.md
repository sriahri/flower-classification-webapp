## Description

Flowers are everywhere around us. They are used for various purposes like
feeding insects, medicinal purposes, etc. One of the dominant approaches for
the classification tasks is Deep Learning. It falls under the category of
Artificial Intelligence. The fundamental task of image classification is to make
sure all the images are categorized according to their groups. When compared
to human’s cognitive ability, it is difficult for the machines to classify the
images based on vision. The Deep Learning model takes in input the image
and gives the output the corresponding flower name. The importance of
building the model is that is stands out in many benefits such as providing fast
recognition for robots. Also, it gives people with limited experience in the
flower species, the ability to recognize the flowers faster and save time and
effort. Recently, the Floriculture has made it important to classify different
types of newly grown flowers to be recognized and present to the outside
world.

This work aims to develop an effective flower classification approach using machine
learning algorithms. Five flower categories were analyzed in order to extract their
features. There are three primary contributions: First, we proposed a classification model
to cultivate the performance of classifying of flower images by using Deep CNN for
extracting the features and various machine learning algorithms for classifying purposes.
Second, we demonstrated the use of image augmentation for achieving better
performance results. Last, we compared the performances of the machine-learning
classifiers such as Naïve bayes or using other algorithms like Random Forest, KNN, and
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This method for classification of flowers can be
implemented in real-time applications and can be used to help botanists for their research
as well as camping enthusiasts. Moreover, the system is capable of automatically
recognize the flower name with a high degree of accuracy.

## Objectives
A web based application using the techniques of Machine
Learning is sought from the Flowers dataset that is capable of
classifying the given input flower into one of the five
categories. The classification of the flower depends on the
closeness of the input flower features with any of the features.
The web application is to deployed in a server if possible in
order to gain wide range access.
